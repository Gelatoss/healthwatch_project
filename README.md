# Health Watch Prototype Project

## Overview
A prototype health watch designed for active individuals, measuring fitness metrics.

## Description
This project involves developing a health watch prototype that features:
- A heart rate sensor for monitoring pulse
- An accelerometer for counting steps
- A display for showing daily stats upon button press

Powered by an ESP32 with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, the watch connects to a mobile application via Bluetooth to transmit user data. The server efficiently handles authentication and authorization processes, ensuring secure communication while serving as an intermediary between the health watch, mobile application, and user data stored in the database.
